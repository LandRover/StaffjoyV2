# Staffjoy V2 - Fork

[![Build Status](https://github.com/LandRover/StaffjoyV2/actions/workflows/ci-master.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LandRover/StaffjoyV2/actions/workflows/ci-master.yaml) [![Godoc Reference](https://godoc.org/v2.staffjoy.com?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/v2.staffjoy.com)

The main purpose of this StaffjoyV2 fork is education. I find in this project very inspiring and learn a lot from the implementation and engineering and monorepo structure.

Current fork will focus on coding standards, testing, DevOps, React, Go and **maybe** a working software on the other end.

There are 2 blood lines for this project:

- The active development branch is [`master`](https://github.com/LandRover/StaffjoyV2), where new features are being added, dependencies updated and processes change.
- The [`minimal-fixes-to-compile`](https://github.com/LandRover/StaffjoyV2/tree/minimal-fixes-to-compile) branch contains minimal changes to this original repo to make it compile without altering the original functionality. Mainly by specifying the version numbers to fit 2016 latest dependencies.

## Staffjoy Original Notice

[Staffjoy is shutting down](https://blog.staffjoy.com/staffjoy-is-shutting-down-39f7b5d66ef6#.ldsdqb1kp), so we are open-sourcing our code. This the second version of our product, a ground-up rewrite intended for small businesses, like restaurants. This product was very simple and did _not_ provide features like allowing workers to log in, clock-in, etc. If you want those features, please use [Staffjoy Suite](https://github.com/staffjoy/suite) You can learn about the design journey from V1 to V2 in [this blog post](https://blog.staffjoy.com/staffjoy-v2-ca15ff1a1169#.e7lmhde6v).

![Staffjoy V2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1312414/29037396-1f0913ba-7b69-11e7-983f-65bea21718d2.png)

We started building V2 in August 2016, became feature complete in November 2016, and [launched to the press in January 2017](http://venturebeat.com/2017/01/10/staffjoy-raises-1-2-million-to-help-small-businesses-manage-workflow-scheduling/).

This is a _monorepo_, so all of the code for all of the services are in this repo. The core technologies are the [Bazel build system](https://bazel.build), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) (including its DNS for internal service discovery), [Redux](http://redux.js.org), [Go](https://golang.org), [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). In staging and production, we used [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/) and their managed databases.

## Services

[![Staffjoy V2 Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/W9UQMuk.jpg)](https://blog.staffjoy.com/staffjoys-v2-architecture-9d2fcb4015fd#.pggmlbtmw)

- `faraday` - Proxies all traffic from external services to internal ones. It also tells backend services whether a user is logged in. It's the only service that has a public IP address!
- `www` - [www.staffjoy.com] is the main marketing website. It also handles login and logout.
- `myaccount` - [myaccount.staffjoy.com] is a single-page javascript app that lets users modify their accounts
- `account-gateway` [account.staffjoy.com] is the externally-available REST api for modifying accounts. It converts REST to gRPC for the accounts-datastore
- `accounts-server` is the internal system that processes gRPC calls and stores/retrieves information using the account database.
- `company-gateway` [company.staffjoy.com] is the externally-available REST api for modifying companies. It converts REST to gRPC for the companys-datastore
- `company-server` is the internal system that processes gRPC calls and stores/retrieves information using the company database.
- `whoami` [whoami.staffjoy.com] is a website that sends information about the current web session for easy access in the front-end.
- `superpowers` [superpowers.staffjoy-v2.local] is a development-only website that lets you gain super user powers across Staffjoy (denoted as "support" flag on user accounts)
- `ical` [ical.staffjoy-v2.local] is service serving up a worker's shift list through ical

### External API Standards

- Services should be RESTful JSON over HTTPS
- Serve the spec at `/swagger.json`
- Use the `apidocs` package to serve a swagger UI at `/ui/`

## Dev

### Getting started

Welcome to Staffjoy!

We use a **monorepo** that stores all of our code in this single repo. We use Vagrant to run a Minikube(Kubernetes) cluster locally on your laptop.
This makes it easy to run all of Staffjoy's services.

### Setting up your Gopath

If you are running Go code, you should [set up your \$GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/install), then clone this repository into the `v2.staffjoy.com` package:

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/
git clone git@github.com:LandRover/StaffjoyV2.git $GOPATH/src/v2.staffjoy.com/
```

### Development station setup - One-time dependencies on host machine (laptop)

- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/), then run `vagrant up` to boot the dev server.
- Vagrant Plugins:
  - Vagrant host manager: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager`
  - Vagrant resize disk: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize`
- [modd](https://github.com/cortesi/modd)

### Running the Environment

Run `make dev`. Code will boot and run at [staffjoy-v2.local](http://www.staffjoy-v2.local). Note that the first time you do this could take up to ~30 minutes in order to provision the VM!

Changes will trigger an automatic rebuild and redeployment. (Check deployment progress at [kubernetes-dashboard url](http://kubernetes.staffjoy-v2.local/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/#/overview?namespace=development)). End the dev server with `control + c` (and it will automatically shut off the VM).

If you run into issues with stuck deployments in development - then run `make dev-k8s-fix` then re-run `make dev`.

### Accessing the environment

Access the VM by running `vagrant ssh`. Code is located in `/home/vagrant/golang/src/v2.staffjoy.com/` (aliased to `$STAFFJOY`, i.e. `cd $STAFFJOY`).

To build code and run it locally, in vagrant go to the code directory `$STAFFJOY` in vagrant, then run `make dev-build` for a one-time build.

If things are really goofing, run `vagrant destroy -f` then rebuild.

### PHPMyAdmin

To view the DB locally you can pop a docker image of PHPMyAdmin:

Login Info:

- Host: http://kubernetes.staffjoy-v2.local:8080
- Login: root/SHIBBOLETH

```
$ docker run --name myadmin -d -e PMA_HOST=10.0.0.100 -p 8080:80 phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
```

### Development resources

- [Kubernetes UI](http://kubernetes.staffjoy-v2.local/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/#/overview?namespace=development). We use the `development` namespace. You can see logs from a "pod" (container) through the UI ([link](http://kubernetes.staffjoy-v2.local/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/#!/pod?namespace=development))
- [HTTP Debugger (for faraday)](http://faraday.staffjoy-v2.local/) - use this to examine headers being sent to internal systems
- [Superpowers lets you do magic things](http://superpowers.staffjoy-v2.local) - use it while logged in to get `support` api permissions in dev.

## Go

### Assets in Go

If you are loading assets like templates, CSS, JS, etc - you need to package the the data into the binary. Otherwise, the app will ship and it won't be able to find the assets!

To do this, use the [go.rice](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice) project. If you modify any of the asset files, you will need to rebuild them then commit the resulting `rice-box.go` file and commit it. You have been warned!

Most services provide a `build.sh` file that compiles all the data that needs to be committed.

### Development tools

The tool [GoConvey](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey) is great for seeing tests.

### Environment variables for configuration

- `ENV`: Set to `development`,`staging`, or `production`. Null defaults to `development`
- `SENTRY_DSN`: Set to the [Sentry](https://sentry.io) api key in every Go service for proper error tracking and reporting

## WSL (Optional)

- Create new file `/etc/wsl.conf`, with the following content:

```
[automount]
enabled = true
options = "metadata,umask=022,fmask=11"

[boot]
command="service ssh restart; service rsyslog restart; service cron restart"
```

Autostart WSL Tutorial via Task: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rM-YcKhd1o
```
wsl -exec dbus-launch true
```

- Install latest Vagrant inside the WSL and the Host
- Install latest Virtualbox
- Run dev env

Enable Create symbolic links:
```
- Open Local Security Policy (gpedit.msc)
- Navigate to: Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment
- Open 'Create Symbolic Links' (SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege)
- Add your username (or a group you are assigned to)
- Restart PC
```

```
> bash
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
$ cd $STAFFJOY
$ make dev-build
```

## Protocol Buffers

If you modify the files in `protobuf/`, run `make protobuf` to recompile all of the generated files.

⚠️ Please make sure that the version of protobuf matches the runtime version ([see this issue](https://github.com/Staffjoy/v2/issues/5#issuecomment-305704425)):

```sh
go install github.com/golang/protobuf/...
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/golang/protobuf/
# Switch to version that is packaged in app
# v1.4.2 May 14, 2020 (LATEST OFFICIAL RELEASE)
git checkout d04d7b157bb510b1e0c10132224b616ac0e26b17
# Re-install
go install github.com/golang/protobuf/proto
cd $GOPATH/src/v2.staffjoy.com/
make protobuf
```

@todo consider updating, many changes

If you're getting started with protocol buffers, here are some resources:

- [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
- [gRPC](http://grpc.io)
- [gRPC health checks](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md)

## Working Offline

- Email will break, but you can look at the system logs for the email service to see what would have been sent. (Useful for grabbing account activation links!)
- See all Go documentation installed on the host machine with `godoc -http=":8080"`. You'll be able to see all docs at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Fork Todos

- Convert internal go build.sh to makefile.
- Deprecate Glide for god modules.
- Added request tracing for `Faraday`, current middleware implemntation (faraday/trace_mw.go) was depricated in https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go (v0.46.0). Using latest, broke since upgrade.
- Migrate Go dependencies to be go.mod based via Bazel. Due to this dependencies currently maintained twice in go.mod and WORKSPACE (bazel).
- Verify GCP deployment to stage and production works with Google Container Engine the same it works in local Kubernetes 1.18+.
- Sentry after upgrading to Go 1.12 threw exceptions - which were fixed but not tested - check still works correctly.
